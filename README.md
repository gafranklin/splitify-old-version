**Project Overview: Splitify**

**Purpose:**
Splitify is a web application designed to simplify expense management and settlement for groups. Ideal for trips, events, or shared living situations, it automates expense tracking, receipt scanning (via OCR), rideshare integration (Uber/Lyft), and optimizes financial settlements among participants.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Storage), Clerk (Authentication), Stripe (Subscriptions), Venmo (Payment Integration)
- **AI Tools:** Cursor (primary AI coding assistant for all development tasks)

**Tools and Techniques:**
- **Database Management:** Implemented PostgreSQL schemas using Supabase to manage profiles, events, expenses, receipts, rideshare data, and settlements.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secured user management and route protection through Clerk.
- **Payments & Subscriptions:** Integrated Stripe for handling premium subscriptions, offering monthly and yearly plans.
- **Payment Integrations:** Venmo integration for quick settlements between users.
- **Cloud Storage:** Utilized Supabase storage buckets for receipt image management with secure access controls.
- **OCR Integration:** Integrated Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for automated expense tracking from receipts.
- **Third-party APIs:** Connected Uber and Lyft APIs for seamless rideshare expense tracking.
- **AI-Assisted Development:** Entire project developed using Cursor, leveraging AI-driven coding enhancements for rapid, efficient, and optimized development workflows.
- **Frontend Framework:** React and Next.js with TypeScript for a robust, scalable frontend with responsive design, utilizing animations and transitions to enhance user experience.

This project served as an exploration and practical application of modern AI-assisted development techniques using Cursor.
